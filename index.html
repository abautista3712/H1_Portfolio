            Hello! My name is Abelard Bautista and I am an aspiring Software
            Developer. I currently work in the field of reproductive genetics as
            a laboratory supervisor but I am looking into transitioning to a
            career more focused in tech. As a lifelong learner, I aspire to
            continue learning about new computer languages and skills that I can
            use to improve my life and the lives of others. At work, I
            independently developed a productivity tool using Microsoft Excel
            for my current company which utilized a variety of macros and nested
            formulas to dynamically sort and provide information based on a
            variety of client parameters. This tool was incorporated by upper
            management as a model for software that all employees in my company
            would use worldwide. Looking towards the future, I am excited to
            immerse myself in tech so as to equip myself with the tools to
            contribute to the development of more of these productivity
            projects.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside of my interest in tech, I have hobbies in beer, music, and
            plants. For the past two years, I have reviewed over 100+ different
            beers that I have tried throughout the world. I have also encouraged
            my friends and family, who also imbibe, to post their own reviews
            using a Google Form that I created. My current top three favorite
            beer types are Double IPAs, Hazy IPAs, and Marzens. One day, I
            aspire to develop an app that can be used for beer reviews and also
            work on other personal projects for people to enjoy.
